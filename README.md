# Synbio For Everyone
Thank you for visiting this respository. This is only a psudo respository representing the work I am doing with programming the Synbio for Everyone Website.
All the code that I have worked on for this project is currently within a private respository that I am unable to share. However, you can see the [rendered site here](https://synbioforeveryone.org/Home).

## My Work
Specifically I worked on the [Blog Page](https://synbioforeveryone.org/Blog) which is currently hidden on the navbar because the club has not written any blog post yet. Currently the blog page only have filler "post" to show what the page will look like when we have real blog posts. On this page, I created a general blog card with the React framework. I then used filled in the blog cards with information about the blog post such as the title, author, approximate read time and even relevant tags about that post.

Each blog card also is searchable with the search bar. Users can search with a specific key words they are looking for. The search functionality is not limited to only titles, in fact users can search for various authors, read time, or even by the tags. Each tag of a blog post is clickable so that you can filter out posts with the matching tag. Currently all of the posts have the events and curriculum tags so if you want to test the tag functionality, then clicking on "other" or "school" will produce more noticable results.

## Current Contributions
I am still currently volunteering for Synbio for Everyone as a web developer. Currently the hosted webpage is an outdated version of the site and updates are mostly done with the coding phase and will be reflected on the hosted site soon.

In addition to the club webpage, I am also helping the club program the website that hosts various curriculum written by club members to teach children about the field of Synthetic Biology. This site is currently not hosted online yet so I will update this file with the link as soon as the curriculum is hosted.

For the curriculum web page, I am currently working on both the front-end and backend portion for this part of the project. In fact, I am currently coding the functionality to retrieve curriculum information such as the text and video version of the curriculuom from a server and displaying that information on the site.
